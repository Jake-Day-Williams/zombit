## Want to contribute?
Here's some todo's off the top of my head. Add them as you think of them.

* Add dashed box around the post you last clicked on when returning to the page.
* Add subreddits (subbits?)
* Signing in on the signup page causes a redirect error.
* A user needs a "posts" button to click where they can see all their posts.
* A user needs a "comments" button to click where they can see all their posts.
* The comment reply box types bold characters.
* Add markdown for comments and posts bodies: With this gem: https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet
* "Post submitted successfully" needs to disappear after a few seconds.
* "Comment submitted successfully" needs to disappear after a few seconds.
* Sort comments by most popular and newest.
* Tests. Tests. Tests.

ADD MORE TODOs (There's lots.)
